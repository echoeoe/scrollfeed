# Scrolling Feed (Work in Progress)

This project is a demo React app for a local nonprofit organization.  

## Pages
Home: https://lina-scrollfeed.vercel.app/  
Login: https://lina-scrollfeed.vercel.app/login

## Goal
Embedded feed allows web visitors to view posts, and nonprofit members to create, edit, and delete posts.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend: 
- HTML (content)
- CSS (styling)
- JavaScript (interactivity)
- React (for creating reusable front-end components and managing state)  
### Backend / Database:
- Supabase (PostgreSQL database, authentication, API)
### Dev / Build Environment:
- Node.js + Vite (develop locally, manage packages, build production files) 
### Hosting / Deployment: 
- Vercel (hosting the front end)

## Tradeoffs
Priority maintainability over feature richness, minimize third-party dependencies.
